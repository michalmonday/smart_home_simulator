So, each heading in the first link need to be in a separate document, these need to be put in corresponding md files. 
The "Individual assessment (from supervisor)" does not need to be done by us.

For instance each person is assigned 1 or more headings, these are written in separate documents under the correct subject in GitLab.  
Once the heading documents are complete, they should be put into 1 md file per subject.  
Add some images relating to what you're writing about, refer to the md resource if you need help with this.

We will need to figure out who is best at writing about what, then split the writing accordingly.
