Below this text is the link for the task completion within Jira.  

[Jira task completion](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/CE292T1902-4)  

I created the initial story for the GitLab task, for everyone on the team:  
[Jira GitLab story](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/CE292T1902-2)

### Sprint 2 - "[Retrospective](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1878&projectKey=CE292T1902&view=reporting&chart=sprintRetrospective&sprint=1430)" (University Week 4, 28/Oct/19 - 04/Nov/19):

When starting with Jira we created issues with our own names, however this was rectified.  
  
I created a task explaining what we had done and what needs to be done.  
[Cleaning up](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/CE292T1902-8?filter=-1&jql=order%20by%20updated%20DESC)

### Sprint 3 - "[Ideas and Qt](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1878&projectKey=CE292T1902&view=reporting&chart=sprintRetrospective&sprint=1640)" (University Week 5, 04/Nov/19 - 11/Nov/19):  
Here I created tasks for our team to find smart devices, this was to create a versatile program with a lot of options for the user.  
[Jira Task](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/CE292T1902-19)  

The idea was Michal's since he does the Qt aspect.  
[My List link](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2019_ce292/ce292_team_2/blob/master/Smart%20device%20ideas/Smart_Device_list__1_.pdf)  

I also was looking into Qt for the function of displaying states of smart devices in our program.  
This involved the idea of changing the displayed image and replacing it with another one when a button was pushed.  
However with the current code this method was not feesable and Michal created a function of his own.  

This function has been explained to me and it makes sense, using built-in Qt functions for the colour pallete and gradient. 
[Research Task](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/CE292T1902-25)  

During this week I also uploaded images that could be used in our program.  
[Images Folder](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2019_ce292/ce292_team_2/tree/master/QT%20Folder/Smart%20Device%20Images)

### Sprint 4 - "[Build/Compile app on Uni PC](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1878&projectKey=CE292T1902&view=reporting&chart=sprintRetrospective&sprint=1713)" (University Week 6, 11/Nov/19 - 18/Nov/19):  

This week the focus was on doing some of the quizzes for CE29x  
[Quiz Task](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/CE292T1902-32?filter=-1&jql=order%20by%20updated%20DESC)  

I also looked into what needed to be done for the MVP.  
[MVP research](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/CE292T1902-31?filter=-1&jql=assignee%20in%20(currentUser())%20order%20by%20updated%20DESC)  

I laid out instructions in an md file in our MVP folder.

### Sprint 5 - "[Group MVP](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1878&projectKey=CE292T1902&view=reporting&chart=sprintRetrospective&sprint=1760)" (University Week 7, 18/Nov/19 - 25/Nov/19):  

The focus for this week was getting an outline for the MVP.  
I created a task for creating a powerpoint, which is still in the works.

Documented the current functionality of the program in the [Demonstration.md](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2019_ce292/ce292_team_2/blob/master/MVP/Demonstration.md) file including gif animations and code samples that show which part of the code is responsible for providing particular functionality.    
Included the risk and user-story issues in the [RequirementsAndRiskLog.md](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2019_ce292/ce292_team_2/blob/master/MVP/RequirementsAndRiskLog.md) file.  
Created template for this file including sprint names with hyperlinks, so it is more convenient to fill by other team members.
